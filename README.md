# Code for Chicago - Gatsby

This is the repository for the [Code for Chicago](www.codeforchicago.org) homepage. The idea is that this will replace the Jekyll implementation.

## Quick Start

Clone the project to your local computer.

If you have Gatsby CLI then run `gatsby develop`

Otherwise `npm start` will also work

## Prettier Settings

This project requires you to have Prettier installed. [Here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode/) is an article to help get you setup if you don't have it installed already.

## Styled Components

We make use of CSS-in-JS as our approach to styles and specifically Styled Components. If you use VS Code it's strongly recommended you install the [styled components syntax highlighting plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components).

## Netlify CMS

The previous instance of the Code for Chicago site used Netlify CMS so we will be implementing that again with Gatsby so that all our content transfers seamlessly.

Currently the CMS is not set up.
